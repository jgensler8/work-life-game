# About {#about}

* Work-Life is a Visual Novel focusing on relationships in a modern workplace
* There are successful routes and failure routes
* The story is kinetic (predetermined) with options affecting only small variations of a story (mainly character preferences)
* There is no conflict between potential interests as the "romance" is a only a subtext

# Inspiration {#inspiration}

It is inspired and loosely based off of [Tokimeki Memorial](https://www.igdb.com/games/tokimeki-memorial-densetsu-no-ki-no-shita-de) with the following differences:
* deeper character story lines
* transparent, no-rng, task-based relationship value replacing hidden stat values
* older characters
* negative action (rumors) replaced with weekend emergency events. tunneling one character's story will not lead to bad end, only slows down relationship gain.
* no cost to check character relations

# Other Notes {#other-notes}

* This was built for the [2024 GBA Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gbajam24).
* It took between 250-400 hours (4-6 hours 6 days a week) over the course of about 80 days.
* It is my first game and [built in honor of NHK](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1210/NHK_ni_Youkoso).
